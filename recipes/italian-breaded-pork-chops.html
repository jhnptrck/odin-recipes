    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These breaded pork chops are from my father's side of the family which is Sicilian. We've been making these pork chops for at least 3 generations. My husband frequently requests these over my marinated and grilled pork chops when I give him a choice. If you do not have an oven-proof skillet, you may cook the chops on the stove at medium-low.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>4 pork chops</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat eggs and milk together in a shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and parsley together in a second shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook until just golden brown to flavor the oil. Remove garlic with a slotted spoon and reserve for another use.</li>
        <li>Dip each pork chop into egg mixture, then bread crumb mixture until well coated.</li>
        <li>Place pork chops in the skillet and cook until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes on each side.</li>
        <li>Transfer the skillet into the preheated oven and bake chops for 25 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
